    React components implement a render() method that takes input data and
     returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input 
    data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.
JSX is optional and not required to use React. Try the Babel REPL to see the 
raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation step.
